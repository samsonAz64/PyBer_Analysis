We do analysis of how PyBer ride share service is  operating by focusing on rider and driver behavior in all the cities. We created graphs that display the total weekly fares,  number of rides and total number of drivers for each city . Our analyis shows how the data vary by city type and bring suggestions of how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer to improve access to ride sharing services and  affordability for underserved costumers.
