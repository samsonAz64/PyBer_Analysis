# PyBer_Analysis
We do analysis of how PyBer ride share service is  operating by focusing on rider and driver behavior in all the cities. We created graphs that display the total weekly fares,  number of rides and total number of drivers for each city . Our analyis shows how the data vary by city type and bring suggestions of how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer to improve access to ride sharing services and  affordability for underserved costumers.

Results


Our analysis revealed that while the highest demand for PyBer rider sharing is in urban cities, urban city drivers saw fares per ride which are 70% lower than rural city drivers. Additionally, rural drivers earn more per ride, but the demand for ride sharing is 92% less than in urban cities, and 80% less than in suburban cities.

The analysis shows distinct differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types that provides patterns of usage that helps PyBer allocating drivers each month. The graph shows a sharp increase in all city types in late February, followed by a sharp decrease.
